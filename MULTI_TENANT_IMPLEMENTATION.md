# Multi-Tenant Inventory Management Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of multi-tenant functionality in the Inventory Management System. Each user now has their own isolated inventory, suppliers, transactions, and related data.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### Entities Modified
All inventory-related entities now include `userId` field and relationship to `User`:

1. **Product** (`inventory/product/product.entity.ts`)
   - Added `userId: string` column (nullable for migration)
   - Added `ManyToOne` relationship to `User`

2. **Category** (`inventory/category/category.entity.ts`)
   - Added `userId: string` column (nullable for migration)
   - Added `ManyToOne` relationship to `User`

3. **Supplier** (`supplier/supplier.entity.ts`)
   - Added `userId: string` column (nullable for migration)
   - Added `ManyToOne` relationship to `User`

4. **Shipment** (`supplier/shipment.entity.ts`)
   - Added `userId: string` column (nullable for migration)
   - Added `ManyToOne` relationship to `User`

5. **Transaction** (`transaction/transaction.entity.ts`)
   - Added `userId: string` column (nullable for migration)
   - Added `ManyToOne` relationship to `User`

#### User Entity Enhanced
**File:** `auth/entities/user.entity.ts`

Added `OneToMany` relationships to:
- Products
- Categories
- Suppliers
- Shipments
- Transactions

### 2. Service Layer Changes

All services updated to include user context filtering:

#### Product Service
**File:** `inventory/product/product.service.ts`
- ‚úÖ `create()` - Auto-assigns `userId`
- ‚úÖ `findAll()` - Filters by `userId`
- ‚úÖ `findOne()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `update()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `remove()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `findByName()` - User-scoped search
- ‚úÖ `searchByName()` - User-scoped search
- ‚úÖ `findLowStockProducts()` - User-specific
- ‚úÖ `findByCategory()` - User-specific
- ‚úÖ `updateStock()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `getTotalValue()` - User-specific calculation

#### Category Service
**File:** `inventory/category/category.service.ts`
- ‚úÖ `create()` - Auto-assigns `userId`
- ‚úÖ `findAll()` - Filters by `userId`
- ‚úÖ `findAllSimple()` - Filters by `userId`
- ‚úÖ `findOne()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `update()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `remove()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `findByName()` - User-scoped search
- ‚úÖ `searchByName()` - User-scoped search

#### Supplier Service
**File:** `supplier/supplier.service.ts`
- ‚úÖ `create()` - Auto-assigns `userId`
- ‚úÖ `findAll()` - Filters by `userId`
- ‚úÖ `findOne()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `findProductsBySupplierCategory()` - User-scoped
- ‚úÖ `update()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `remove()` - Verifies ownership (cascades to shipments)
- ‚úÖ `getSupplierStats()` - User-specific statistics

#### Shipment Service
**File:** `supplier/shipment.service.ts`
- ‚úÖ `create()` - Auto-assigns `userId`, updates only user's products
- ‚úÖ `findAll()` - Filters by `userId`
- ‚úÖ `findOne()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `findBySupplier()` - User-scoped
- ‚úÖ `updatePaymentStatus()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `remove()` - Verifies ownership, reverts user's product stock

#### Transaction Service
**File:** `transaction/transaction.service.ts`
- ‚úÖ `createTransaction()` - Auto-assigns `userId`, validates user's products
- ‚úÖ `findAll()` - Filters by `userId`
- ‚úÖ `findOne()` - Verifies ownership
- ‚úÖ `findByCustomer()` - User-scoped
- ‚úÖ `findByEmployee()` - User-scoped
- ‚úÖ `getDailySales()` - User-specific analytics
- ‚úÖ `getSalesOverview()` - User-specific analytics
- ‚úÖ `getTopProducts()` - User-specific analytics
- ‚úÖ `getPaymentMethodStats()` - User-specific analytics
- ‚úÖ `getRevenueByCategory()` - User-specific analytics

### 3. Resolver Layer Changes

All resolvers updated with authentication guards and user context:

#### Authentication Setup
- ‚úÖ Added `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` to all resolvers
- ‚úÖ Added `@CurrentUser()` decorator to extract user from JWT
- ‚úÖ Pass `user.id` to all service methods

#### Updated Resolvers
1. **ProductResolver** - All queries/mutations user-scoped
2. **CategoryResolver** - All queries/mutations user-scoped
3. **SupplierResolver** - All queries/mutations user-scoped
4. **ShipmentResolver** - All queries/mutations user-scoped
5. **TransactionResolver** - All queries/mutations user-scoped
6. **Analytics Queries** - All analytics user-specific

### 4. Data Isolation Strategy

#### Row-Level Security
- Every query automatically filters by `userId`
- Users can only access their own data
- Cross-user data access is prevented at the database layer

#### Ownership Verification
- Create operations: Auto-assign current user's ID
- Read operations: Filter by user ID
- Update operations: Verify ownership before modification
- Delete operations: Verify ownership before deletion

#### Related Data Handling
- **Products & Categories**: User can only link their own categories to their products
- **Suppliers & Shipments**: Shipments can only reference user's suppliers
- **Transactions & Products**: Transactions can only include user's products
- **Stock Updates**: Only affects user's own product stock

## üîí Security Features

### 1. Authentication Required
All inventory operations require valid JWT token with user information.

### 2. Authorization Enforced
Users cannot:
- View other users' inventory
- Modify other users' data
- Link to other users' categories/products/suppliers
- See other users' analytics/reports

### 3. Data Integrity
- Foreign key relationships maintained within user scope
- Cascade deletes respect user boundaries
- Stock updates only affect user's products

## üìä User Experience

### For Each User:
1. **Independent Inventory**: Complete isolation from other users
2. **Personal Analytics**: Sales reports show only their data
3. **Own Suppliers**: Manage their own supplier relationships
4. **Private Transactions**: Transaction history is private
5. **Custom Categories**: Create and manage their own product categories

## üîÑ Migration Path

### For Existing Data:
Since `userId` columns are nullable, existing data will work but:
- Existing records have `userId = null`
- Need to run a migration to assign existing data to users
- Recommended: Create a default/admin user and assign old data

### Migration Script (to be created):
```sql
-- Option 1: Assign to a specific user
UPDATE product SET "userId" = 'admin-user-id' WHERE "userId" IS NULL;
UPDATE category SET "userId" = 'admin-user-id' WHERE "userId" IS NULL;
UPDATE suppliers SET "userId" = 'admin-user-id' WHERE "userId" IS NULL;
UPDATE shipments SET "userId" = 'admin-user-id' WHERE "userId" IS NULL;
UPDATE transactions SET "userId" = 'admin-user-id' WHERE "userId" IS NULL;

-- Option 2: Make userId NOT NULL after assignment
ALTER TABLE product ALTER COLUMN "userId" SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE category ALTER COLUMN "userId" SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE suppliers ALTER COLUMN "userId" SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE shipments ALTER COLUMN "userId" SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE transactions ALTER COLUMN "userId" SET NOT NULL;
```

## üìù Frontend Impact

### Required Frontend Changes:
1. **No schema changes** - Frontend GraphQL queries remain the same
2. **Authentication required** - All requests must include JWT token
3. **User-scoped data** - Results automatically filtered by backend
4. **No manual userId passing** - Backend extracts from auth token

### Frontend Benefits:
- Cleaner code (no manual user filtering)
- More secure (server-side enforcement)
- Better UX (only relevant data shown)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Create Migration Script**
   - Assign existing data to users
   - Make userId columns NOT NULL

2. **Test with Multiple Users**
   - Create test users
   - Verify data isolation
   - Check cross-user access prevention

3. **Update Frontend**
   - Ensure JWT tokens included in all requests
   - Remove any frontend-side user filtering
   - Test with multiple user accounts

4. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Add user isolation notes
   - Document migration process

## üéâ Benefits Achieved

‚úÖ **Complete Data Isolation** - Each user has their own inventory
‚úÖ **Scalable Architecture** - Support unlimited users
‚úÖ **Secure by Default** - Server-side authorization
‚úÖ **Maintainable Code** - Clear separation of concerns
